PHYSICS: Short Answer: In 1936, scientist looking for the recently-proposed pion, found a track in a cloud chamber that matched the theoretical track of the pion. However, it was discovered that the particle was slightly lighter than expected and, while having both positive and negative versions, did not have a neutral version, as the pion should.
