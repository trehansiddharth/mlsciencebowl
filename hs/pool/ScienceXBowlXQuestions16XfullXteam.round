Round [Double (Short (Tag "Rohan Deshpande") ERSP "As the universe expanded and cooled in the time following the big bang, the glow from the warm gas faded into infrared wavelengths. This marked the beginning of a period where the gas was too cool to emit visible wavelengths, but was not yet able to form stars. As a result the universe was totally pitch black. What term do cosmologists give to this period lasting for about 400 million years?\n\n" "Dark Age") (Short (Tag "Rohan Deshpande") ERSP "Order the following cosmological time periods following the big bang from first to last: photon and particle soup, dark age, recombination, reionization, nucleosynthesis\n\n" "PHOTON AND PARTICLE SOUP, NUCLEOSYNTHESIS, RECOMBINATION, DARK AGE, REIONIZATION"),Double (Short (Tag "Rohan Deshpande") Physics "A 1 kg box is pulled by a rope at an angle of 60 degrees above the horizontal.
