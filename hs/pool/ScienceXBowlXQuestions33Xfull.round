Its velocity through the second section of the pipe is greater than that at the first section of the pipe. By name or number, identify all of the following three statements which MUST be true1. the fluid's pressure in the second section is lower\n2. the fluid's flow rate is constant through the two sections\n3. if the height of the second section of pipe is lower than that of the first, then the fluid's pressure in the second section is higher\n\n" "2 and 3")]
