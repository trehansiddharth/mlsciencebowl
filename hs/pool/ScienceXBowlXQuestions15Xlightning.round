Round [Single (Short (Tag "Rohan Deshpande") Physics "Bob the bricklayer pulls a 10 kg stack of bricks straight up a 1 m high wall. He then decides to build a ramp that is elevated at 30 degrees above the vertical and push the bag of bricks up the ramp to the top of the wall. If the ramp is 1 meter high and Bob pushed the bag for 2 meters, neglecting the force of friction, what is the difference in work done on the bag between pushing the bricks up the ramp and lifting them straight up to the nearest Joule?ANSWER: 0 JOULES3.
